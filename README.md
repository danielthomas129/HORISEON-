# READ ME

HORISEON is the first assignment for the class where we have to edit a landing page to showcase different styling changes.

## CONTENTS
The project composes a refactored website including an index.html page and a style2.css sheet. Changes were made to meets accessibility standards
SO THAT the site is optimized for search engines.

The index.html page holds the structure of the page (header, body, containers, etc). All the components of the page are linked to a class or attribute ID in order to load the styles defined in style2.css for each section. In the header of the file we defined the location for the Style Sheet, and other attributes needed for the site to be responsive.

The Style Sheet (style2.css) defines the styling for the different sections of the website. This file defines the styles for the classes and IDs specified for each container.


## CHANGELOG
- Img object in line 82 changed from "<img></img>" to <img "src" />


## INSTALLATION
To install/view this project copy both index.html and style2.css files to the same folder of the web server, or to the same GitHub repository.
